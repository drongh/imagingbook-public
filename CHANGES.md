# Recent Changes

* [2019/12/22] Submodules with plugins for specific book editions have been frozen and
will not be maintained any longer. The complete plugin collection is contained in
``imagingbook_plugins_all``. ZIP-archives of the specific plugin sets are now found in
``plugins-archive``.

* [2019/01/04] Revised geometric mappings (in package ``imagingbook.pub.geometry.mappings``) and related demo plugins. Image-to-image mappings were moved to the new class ``ImageMapper``, for mappings to handle only geometric aspects.
